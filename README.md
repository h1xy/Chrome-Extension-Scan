# Background
圣诞节前夕，数据丢失预防服务 Cyber​​haven 的开发者收到了据称来自 Google 的邮件，称该公司的 Chrome 扩展没有遵守 Google 的条款，要求立即采取行动，否则扩展将会被下架。邮件包含的链接指向了一个 Google 同意屏幕，要求获得 OAuth 应用 Privacy Policy Extension 的访问授权。Cyber​​haven 的一名开发者同意了授权，攻击者利用该授权向 Chrome Web Store 上传了包含后门的新版本。从 12 月 25 日 1:32 AM UTC 到 26 日 2:50 AM UTC 之间，运行中的 Chrome 浏览器会自动下载恶意版本 v24.10.4。Cyber​​haven 注意到这一安全事件，迅速释出了新版本。这一攻击事件公开之后，安全研究人员发现至少 36 个 Chrome 扩展遭到了相似的钓鱼攻击，其中部分被植入后门的恶意扩展在 Chrome Web Store 存在了 18 个月之久。这些扩展的总安装量约 260 万。大部分受影响扩展与 AI 工具和 VPN 相关，如 GPT 4 Summary with OpenAI，Proxy SwitchyOmega(V3)，Wayin AI，AI Assistant - ChatGPT and Gemini for Chrome，等等。

On the eve of Christmas, developers of the data loss prevention service Cyberhaven received an email allegedly from Google, claiming that the company’s Chrome extension did not comply with Google’s terms and requiring immediate action, or else the extension would be removed. The email contained a link to a Google consent screen, requesting access authorization for the OAuth application Privacy Policy Extension. A developer from Cyberhaven agreed to the authorization, allowing the attacker to upload a new version containing backdoors to the Chrome Web Store. Between December 25 at 1:32 AM UTC and December 26 at 2:50 AM UTC, running Chrome browsers would automatically download the malicious version v24.10.4. Cyberhaven noticed this security incident and quickly released a new version. After this attack was made public, security researchers discovered that at least 36 Chrome extensions had been similarly targeted by phishing attacks, some of which had malicious backdoors and had existed in the Chrome Web Store for as long as 18 months. The total number of installations for these extensions was around 2.6 million. Most affected extensions were related to AI tools and VPNs, such as GPT 4 Summary with OpenAI, Proxy SwitchyOmega (V3), Wayin AI, AI Assistant - ChatGPT and Gemini for Chrome, and so on.
